# Robotic Vacuum Cleaner Management Web Application

This project is a web application built with **Java Spring Boot** for the backend and **TypeScript** for the frontend, allowing users to manage their robotic vacuum cleaners. The application provides an intuitive interface for controlling and monitoring multiple robotic vacuums.

## Project Overview

- **User Management**: Users can add, update, and remove robotic vacuum cleaners from their account.
- **Control and Monitoring**: Users can start, stop, and schedule cleaning tasks for their vacuum cleaners.
- **Dashboard**: Provides a real-time overview of the status and activity of each robotic vacuum cleaner.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Java Spring Boot is used to handle REST APIs, manage database connections, and execute business logic.
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Built with TypeScript for strong typing and modern web development practices.

## Key Features

- **Add/Remove Vacuums**: Easily add new robotic vacuum cleaners or remove existing ones.
- **Schedule Cleanings**: Set up automated cleaning schedules based on user preferences.
- **Real-Time Status**: Monitor current activity, battery levels, and cleaning progress of vacuum cleaners.
